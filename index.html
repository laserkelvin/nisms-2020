  <h1>Not ISMS 2020</h1>

  <h2> Virtual conference for early career Physical Chemistry researchers </h2>

  <h3> June 22â€’26, 2020 </h3>

  <p class="drop-cap">
      The <a href="https://isms.illinois.edu/">International Symposium on Molecular Spectroscopy</a> has been a long running meeting
      for spectroscopists, chemists, physicists, and astronomers to meet and exchange ideas on an annual basis. Due to the unfortunate
      timing of Covid-19, the 75th landmark of the meeting was forced to be postponed. Among those who miss out the most are <strong> early
      career researchers</strong>: undergraduates, graduates, and postdoctoral fellows who now do not get the opportunity to present their research
      in a scientifically and socially enriching environment.
  </p>

  <p> Registration is free, and necessary for us to communicate details about the conference to you all.
      You can register by going to <a href="https://forms.gle/BFYWAidmMbKJy1d68">this link here.</a>
